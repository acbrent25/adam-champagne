						<p>I Started working with Adam on my website for my restaurant. From the very first meet and greet, Adam has been nothing short of helpful, creative, easy to work with and understanding. It can be difficult trying to get your ideas and style across on a website, but Adam got exactly our style and layout and delivered a product that we are so happy with. I would recommend these guys to anyone after a new website or social media help</p>

								<p>The website that was designed for us before had no wow factor and we were looking to "upgrade" and take Viaggio's website to the next level. ​We had been looking at websites and came across Common Lot's website and saw that it was asthetically pleasing.​ We got on a quick call and meeting was quickly set up. Adam showed us what was missing on our website in terms capturing and turning web views into possible reservations. Once a plan was set Adam wasted no time and was quick and efficient in our website build out. He kept us constantly updated with drafts of the website buildout. He listened and had quick turn around times with changes we requested while giving us his professional option on why some changes were best kept unchanged. Not only did he build us a much better website to navigate as a guest it's one of the best looking websites out there. Adam was more than efficient with the build out and timeline he presented and i would definatley recomend him to anyone!

									<p>Adam has fans around the world, when they see his work for Standup Journal. Few stand up paddlers realize how few people generate the 4x a year magazine that set the world standard in the sport.</p>
